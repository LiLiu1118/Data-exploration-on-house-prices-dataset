# Data-exploration-on-house-prices-dataset
In this project we put in practice many strategies to explore the house prices dataset. We looked into the variables, analysed 'SalePrice' alone and with the most correlated variables, we dealt with missing data and outliers, we tested some of the fundamental statistical assumptions and we even transformed categorial variables into dummy variables with the help of different Python libraries.
